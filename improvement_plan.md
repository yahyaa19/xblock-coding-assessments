# XBlock Improvement Plan

## Issue Analysis

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified the specific problems:

### 1. Multi-File UI Issues
- **File Explorer**: Layout is cramped and not intuitive
- **Editor Tabs**: Missing proper tab management functionality  
- **File Operations**: Create/Delete/Rename workflows are incomplete
- **Monaco Integration**: Multi-file switching is not properly implemented
- **Responsive Design**: UI breaks on smaller screens

### 2. Test Case Issues
- **Test Execution**: Test case runner logic is incomplete
- **Result Display**: Test results UI is present but not functional
- **Judge0 Integration**: Multi-file submission doesn't handle test cases properly
- **Error Handling**: Test failures are not properly reported

## Fixes Needed

### Multi-File UI Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced File Explorer
```javascript
// Better file tree with drag-and-drop support
// Improved icons and visual hierarchy
// Context menu for file operations
```

#### 2. Improved Editor Tabs
```javascript
// Tab overflow handling
// Close buttons with unsaved changes warning
// Better tab switching animation
```

#### 3. Monaco Integration Enhancement
```javascript
// Multiple Monaco instances or proper model switching
// Syntax highlighting per file type
// Auto-save functionality
```

### Test Case System Fix

#### 1. Test Case Execution Engine
```python
# Proper test runner with timeout handling
# Support for multiple test cases
# Integration with Judge0 for execution
```

#### 2. Test Results UI
```javascript
# Real-time test execution feedback
# Detailed error reporting
# Test case comparison view
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Development Setup
1. Set up XBlock workbench for rapid testing
2. Create test data for multi-file projects
3. Set up API keys for Judge0 and LLM services

### Phase 2: UI Improvements
1. Redesign file explorer with better UX
2. Implement proper tab management
3. Fix Monaco editor integration
4. Improve responsive design

### Phase 3: Test Case System
1. Implement robust test execution
2. Create test result visualization
3. Add test case management interface
4. Integrate with AI evaluation

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish
1. Comprehensive testing with workbench
2. Performance optimization
3. Error handling improvements
4. Documentation updates

## Quick Wins (Start Here)

### 1. Fix File Creation Modal (30 minutes)
The file creation modal needs better validation and feedback.

### 2. Improve Tab Switching (1 hour) 
Tab switching between files is broken - needs proper Monaco model management.

### 3. Test Case Display (45 minutes)
Test results are not showing up - fix the UI update logic.

### 4. Responsive Layout (1 hour)
Multi-file interface breaks on mobile - improve CSS media queries.

Would you like me to start with any specific fix? I recommend beginning with the file creation modal and tab switching as they're the most visible issues.
